**Frontend:**
 
As far as the frontend, we were able to continue on with the same login page. However, we were able to make changes in the home page. We made our home page more visually appealing by adding all the text to one side of the home page screen. A short catchphrase was added to the homepage to express what purpose this homepage can be used for. We were also able to implement a menu bar and home button that will lead to the corresponding instruction one may need to execute. If we take the mouse cursor to the menu located at the top of the homepage, we can see that the color of the menu changes to gray and is recognized. In addition, if we put the cursor on four other menus except for the home menu, the submenus of each menu can be seen.

**Unit Tests Frontend:**

We tested for valid login credentials with different usernames and passwords so a user is able to put in a username and password unique to them  and be able to login into their own account. We tested for a working home button in the main menu. We tested for a menu button at the home page. We tested for invalid login credentials, so any user can't just login to another person’s account. We tested for the correct text to be displayed when one enters the website.

**Backend:**

The structure of user profiles at this point is largely complete, with some room for minor tweaking. Excess and unused code have been removed from the file, and the rest of the helper functions for updating individual structs are finished. The code has been fully commented, with the exception of the test file, as the naming convention for test functions makes them somewhat self explanatory. 

The development of the RESTful API that was started during Sprint 2 is now nearly complete. The RESTful API is now able to access the MySQL database and manipulate any of the records found (GET, PUT and DELETE), but there is currently an issue with creating a new record in the database (POST). It should be noted that the GET method has two different endpoints, which have different URL paths and functions. The first endpoint for the GET method only includes the accounts table in the URL path and uses a function that retrieves every record in the accounts table. The second endpoint for the GET method includes a username after the accounts table in the URL path and uses a function that searches the accounts table for that specific username. Both of the endpoints for the GET method show the usernames and passwords for every record that was retrieved. The PUT method has a URL path that includes a username and it uses a function that replaces the password of the record with the specified username with the password that was specified in the request. The DELETE method has a URL path that includes a username and uses a function that deletes the record with the specified username from the MySQL database. The POST method also has a URL path that includes a username and uses a function that creates a new record with the specified username and password that was sent in the request. However, the POST method is the only method that is not working as expected. As of now, it can create records with the password specified in the request, but it currently only works with the default name, which was set to “John.” 

**Unit Tests Backend:**

The unit tests that were made to test the structure of user profiles during Sprint 3 were constructed in the same manner as Sprint 2. Two stucts are created with on small difference, for example the usernames. The function being tested is run, and the structs are compared using deep equal. The primary focus on tests for this sprint were focused on the resume structure and the blog structure, which was ultimately removed as it did not align with our concept of Boggle. Each of the values in the resume that are able to be edited by users has been tested and works as intended.

The GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods for the RESTful API were tested on Postman, which is an API platform that allows developers to test their APIs. To test both endpoints of the GET method, I created two records in the accounts table by using the MySQL command line. Afterwards, I tested the endpoint that retrieves every record by setting the request URL to only include the accounts table and sending the request, which returned the two records that were previously created as expected. I then tested the endpoint for the GET method that retrieves the record with a specified username by setting the request URL to include a specific username and sending the request, which returns the record that contains the specified username as expected. The POST method was first tested by setting the request URL to only include the accounts table and sending a request that also has body data that includes the username and password for the new account. However, this would result in an error that says that the field “username” does not have a default value, which is why the default username was set to be “John.” Afterwards, the POST method was tested again and it resulted in the newly created account that has the username “John” regardless of what the username in the request was, as well as a password that matches the password specified in the request. This means that the request was able to be sent, but there is currently an issue somewhere in the logic for inserting the username from a request into a newly added record. The PUT method was then tested by setting the request URL to include a specific username and sending a request that also has body data that includes a new password for the account with the specified username. After sending the request, the record in the MySQL database with the specified username has the new password that was sent in the body data of the request instead of the previous one, which is expected. The DELETE method was tested by setting the request URL to include a specific username and sending the request, which resulted in the record that has the specified username to be removed from the MySQL database, which is expected.

**Documentation for Backend APIs:**

RESTful API- This RESTful API is used to connect the Angular application to the Go server, which is connected to a MySQL database that will be used to store user profile information. With the RESTful API, the angular application will be able to send requests to the Go server for either  the retrieval or the manipulation of specified User profiles that are stored in the MySQL database and the Go server will be able to send a response back, which consists of the resources (user profiles) that were requested or confirmation that the action that was requested has been carried out. Due to being a RESTful API, it uses the HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. This means that the actions that can be requested by the Angular application are to retrieve a user profile, create a new user profile, update the information on a user profile or delete a user profile. As of now, this API will be used to simply store a user profile’s username and password. The username will be the primary key that is used to identify a unique record in the MySQL database, which means that the username will be used to determine which record will get updated, deleted or retrieved when a request is sent from the angular application.
