**Frontend**

In sprint 4, we changed We changed the UI and design of the login screen and put our project name on the right. The home screen where you log in and move on is not much different from print 3. However, the number of menus created in sprint 3 was reduced to three, and when each menu was clicked, it was moved to the corresponding screen.
In addition, information on the website and information such as e-mails and phone numbers that can be contacted were added to the website. User can also click on the "Contact" menu to send messages to people user can contact. Finally, User can view the user's profile by clicking the profile that exists in the upper right corner, and user can also log out by clicking the Logout button.
