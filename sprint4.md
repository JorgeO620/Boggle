**Frontend**

In sprint 4, we changed the UI of the login screen and made it more proffesional looking to make it appeal to a user. We also made changes to the home screen to where it displays recruiter information and a litttle summary about them. We also implemented a box to display current events and news configured to each user and their previous searches and related interests. We also created an about us page where it displays a little bit of background of our company and added an address, phone number, and company email. We made changes to the "my profile" page where it is able to display a users profile information. We also impleneted a "connect" tab where users are able to connect with recruiters and be able to send them messages.

**Backend Unit Tests**

In Sprint 4 we wrote unit tests for functions using the Restful API. By declaring a variable as httptest.NewRecorder(), I was able to monitor the output of each function locally and compare it to desired outputs. Unit tests were constructed for all methods finalized. In addition, server side unit tests remain as they were in the previous sprint.
