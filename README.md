Project Description:
The number one problem that newly graduated college students face is finding a job. I know this because graduation is coming up and I am currently having a difficult time finding one. With not knowing where to start and with the help of others I came across a platform that everyone loves and uses by the name of linkedin.

Linkedin is the world's largest professional network on the internet. You can use LinkedIn to find the right job or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills you need to succeed in your career. However it can be difficult to connect with people with 500+ connections making it hard to get noticed. Constantly displays incomplete profile challenges making it more time consuming for one to complete. The thought of getting your identity stolen. The premium package is severely costly and companies aren’t willing to post job listings on linkedin thinking it will ruin their reputation.

With all these limitations in mind and while being a college student about to graduate I am restricted on time. I am also keen to connect with some of the more influential individuals running bigger companies however linkedin hinders to let me connect with them and rather lets me follow their page and see their postings.

Other social networking sites such as Monster, Indeed, Craigslist, Coffee Chat, and Lets Lunch are also great website but are the byproduct of linkedin. These other social networking sites are not aesthetically pleasing, are difficult to navigate through, prone to scams, offer little to no additional resources, not reaching a large audience, and provide no definite incentive for the individuals.

So I introduce to you Boggle

Boggle is soon to be the first social networking platform that resolves the limitations that these companies have to offer. Boggle is like your one stop shop.

Our mission statement or goal is to connect people with their dream jobs and individuals that they wish to connect with.

Boggle will offer services that are both cost and time efficient. We aim to make an aesthically pleasing website that is easily able to navigate through that doesn’t require too much personal information protecting user data and allowing to base intelligence soley based on the perwon rather than what their resume says.

The boggle business model to generate revenue
•	Market more influential people that will use the network 
o	Celeberties 
o	Influential entrepreneurs 
•	Being able to pay an individual directly
o	Through our website users are able to pay an individual directly to expedite services ask question, advice, or simply propose business concepts.
o	Users can be easily able to setup up online virtual conferences with an individual
o	Charge big corporations to have their listings put on there to generate more revenue
o	Rather than paying a monthly subscription to linkedin to potentially message 100s of recruiters that may not reach back you, one can pay a small fee and will be put on top of the list, incentivizing the user and recipient and making it able to make a stronger connection with a particular individual
